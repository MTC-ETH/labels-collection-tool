# Labels collection tool
This is a fullstack tool to manually pair unlabelled data with labels.

This tool was created by the [ETH Media Technology Center (MTC)](https://mtc.ethz.ch/)
in the scope of the project Emotion and Stance detection for German text.

The goal of the tool is to create an easy-to-deploy platform to allow students
or workers to label the dataset. For the aforementioned project we needed to pair each
paragraph of a news article with an emotion and assign a stance to the whole article.
Nonetheless, it's really easy to customize the tool to your data labelling needs,
given the modularity of react.

You can browse an example deployment of the project at [https://mtc-emotion-stance.herokuapp.com/](https://mtc-emotion-stance.herokuapp.com/) or 
look at the following screenshot of the emotion collection part (in German).

### Technologies
The backend is built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), 
[mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and its node implementation 
[mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/).
The front end uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) (and HTML, CSS, Javascript).


## Repository structure and how to customize
#### Backend 
The server backend is contained in the main folder of the repository. 

`app.js` conntects to the mongodb and contains the express server and exposes the REST API, by linking to the 
routes contained in the `routes` folder, where each file corresponds to the respective 
front-end page. For example `admindashboard.js` replies to all the queries that are responsible
to populate the page with the same name in the frontend. <br/>
The `models` folder contains the mongodb schema definiton and some utility functions to work on it. <br/>
The `utils` folders contains files to insert content in the database when creating the server,
a script needed when building in Heroku and a `.service` file useful in case of a deployment on
a local machine. <br/>
The `json` folder can contain information to be added to the database, for example articles.  

`config.js` contains important configuration properties that apply to the backend. Please
refer to the comments in the file for more information.

#### Frontend
All the frontend is contained in the folder `client`, please refer to the readme in that 
folder for its explanation.

## Run on localhost in dev mode
- Install mongodb via: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/ 
- Start mongo daemon: `sudo systemctl start mongod`
- Install nodejs and npm, for example by following: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/
- `npm install` to install the packages required by the backend
- `npm start` to start the backend on port 5000
- `cd client` to locate yourself in the client folder
- `npm install` to install the packages required by the frontend
- `npm start` to start the frontend on port 3000. You'll be redirected to the browser automatically.

## Choose user registration process
Two registration processes are available, one not automatic and privacy preserving, a second
automatic and less privacy oriented.

By default the tool runs in privacy preserving mode. In this mode the registration page explains
to the user that to register they have to send a registration request by email. The registration
request is processed by a human that under the admindashboard page generates a new token and
sends it back to the user. The server only retains the generated tokens and no personal info
about the user.

The automatic mode instead automatically sends a login token to the user with a predefined email
and saves in the database the name, surname, email and other info of the labellers.
To enable this mode:
- create a `.env` file in the `client` directory and insert one line stating 
`REACT_APP_AUTOMATIC_REGISTRATION="true"`
- if not existent, create a `.env` file in the main folder and add the lines:
```
EMAIL="myfavouritemail@gmail.com"
EMAIL_PASS="<pass>"
```
Where, in case of gmail, the password can be an app password generated by the gmail website.


## Deployment on Heroku
An example of such deploymen can be found at [https://mtc-emotion-stance.herokuapp.com/](https://mtc-emotion-stance.herokuapp.com/)

To deploy:
- Follow the guide for the regular node.js heroku deployment: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-nodejs
- Create a free database at https://www.mongodb.com/free-cloud-database
- In the Heroku dashboard, under `settings --> config vars`, set:
  - `MONGODB_URI` to the URI of the just created mongodb, for example 
  `mongodb+srv://myprojectnme:mypassword@myclustername.ywdlx.azure.mongodb.net/mydbname`
  - `ADMIN_TOKEN` to a random id
  - `NODE_ENV` to `heroku`
  - `BASE_LINK` to the base link of your project (no slash at the end), for example
  `https://mtc-emotion-stance.herokuapp.com` <br/><br/>
  Optionally, to setup the automatic email registration:
  - `REACT_APP_AUTOMATIC_REGISTRATION` to `true`
  - `EMAIL` to the sender email
  - `EMAIL_PASS` to the sender email password
- run `git push herku master` to finalize the deployment
  
  
  
## Deployment on any machine
This guide applies to any general deployment, also on ETH D-INFK virtual servers.
### General requirements
Mongodb:
- Install mongodb via: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/ 
- Start mongo daemon: `sudo systemctl start mongod`
- Check daemon is running: `sudo systemctl status mongod`
- Automatically load daemon every startup: `sudo systemctl enable mongod`

Nodejs and npm:
- Please follow any tutorial on nodejs and npm installation, for example:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/

### Code from the repo
Clone this repository, then 

#### Client:
- Build the react client for production: `cd client && npm run build`. This
will create an optimized version of the react client and will allow the 
backend in node to serve it.

#### Backend:
- Create in the main directory of the project a `.env` file with the right information:
```
ADMIN_TOKEN="<token>"
EMAIL="emotionandstance.mtc@gmail.com"
EMAIL_PASS="<email-pass>"
EMAIL_BACKUP="luca.campanella1@gmail.com"
MONGODB_URI="mongodb://localhost/labelling_tool"
NODE_ENV="production"
PORT=443
KEY_PATH="/etc/ssl/private/voice-recordings.mtc.ethz.ch.key"
CERT_PATH="/etc/ssl/certs/voice-recordings.mtc.ethz.ch.crt.pem"
```
Optionally a different port for the http redirection service can be specified by: `HTTP_ONLY_PORT=8080`

Where `ADMIN_TOKEN` is just a secret sequence of letters and numbers that will
allow you to access the "hidden" admin page at the address: `maindomain.com//admindashboard?token=<token>`. Note
that to access this page you'll also need to be running the server on localhost or
accessing from the same subnet. (For ETH network just turn on the VPN)

`MONGODB_URI` is the URI of mongodb, it can be localhost if running a local
mongo deployment or remote otherwise.
`NODE_ENV` should be set to production for deployment. This will make sure
the connections at https work and the http ones will be redirected to https.
`KEY_PATH` and `CERT_PATH` should point to the local `*.key` and `*.pem` files
for the https / TLS deployment.

Test that everything is up and running:
- `sudo node app.js`

You should be able to access the server from the usual links and the DNS redirection, 
for example: `https://idvm-infk-mtc01.inf.ethz.ch/ `

For ETH deployment, in order to add a new DNS alias, it's necessary to contact the ISG.

#### Make the server a daemon
In order to make the server run at startup and re-start in case of crashes we need
to make it a daemon. This is done by defining one in the file `utils/labelling-tool-backend.service`
- copy the service file in the service directories: `sudo cp utils/labelling-tool-backend.service /lib/systemd/system/labelling-tool-backend.service`
- make the service run at startup: `sudo systemctl enable labelling-tool-backend.service`
- reboot or alternatively reload the service via `sudo systemctl daemon-reload labelling-tool-backend.service`
- check that the server is running in the background by looking at the logs: `sudo journalctl -u labelling-tool-backend`


### Troubleshooting
Which service is running on which port: `sudo netstat -tulp`
