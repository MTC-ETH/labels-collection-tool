                <h3>3 - Stance of the article towards a topic</h3>
                <h5>Task definition</h5>
                <p>You are then asked to select the stance of the article towards
                    a given topic. You are given a question and 4 possible answers <i>in favour, discussing,
                        against</i> and <i>unrelated</i>. An example question can be: <i>Should abortion be legal?</i>.
                    The meaning of the four possible answers follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <i>Ja, daf√ºr</i> means the article agrees with the question and
                        has a positive stance towards the topic
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i>Diskutierend</i> means the article talks about the topic, but does not take
                        a clear stance
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i>Nein, gegen</i> means the article disagrees with the question and
                        has a negative stance towards the topic
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i>Kein Bezug</i> means the article does not talk about the topic and does not address the
                        question.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h5>User interface example</h5>
                Below you can find an example of how the user interface looks. Again, feel free to
                play with the interface.
                <div className={"mt-2"}>
                    <h5 style={{color: Labelling.defaultProps.instructionsTextColor}}>Should abortion be legal?</h5>
                </div>
                <StanceSelectorOrizontal onClick={this.handleStanceArticle}
                                         stanceStatus={this.state.stanceArticleQuestionLabel}/>
            </Col>
        </Row>;
