# Frontend of Labels collection tool
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Folder structure
`package.json` describes the requirements for the software to run. Don't edit this file manually,
to install all the required packages wun `npm install`.<br/>
The `src` folder contains the source files and in particular `index.js` which acts as a router
for the other pages, contained in the `view` folder. <br/>
The `components` folder contains single react components that are used by the single page,
organized in folders that have the same name of the page that uses them. <br\>
The `assets` folder just contains images.

## Available Scripts
After installing `node.js` and `npm` on your machine, in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Install the dependencies in the local node_modules folder. The dependencies are described in the
`package.json`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm install --save <pkg_name>`

Install the package <pkg_name> and save the requirement for future installations.
